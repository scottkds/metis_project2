We have remodeled a house by the sea in a 30-second walk to the beach that makes us feel Showa. The facility name ""Hayamana"" is a combination of Hayama (Hayama) and Mana (soul). It's not a luxury, but it's a nostalgic, calming and relaxing atmosphere. And there is a stand-up paddle rental at the property, and even beginners can receive a school. Owners are PSA (Professional SUP Association) certified professionals, so you can enjoy the sea activities to the fullest with peace of mind. There is also a 5-minute walk to the trail entrance surrounded by the greenery of Hayama, which is unexpectedly unknown. It is a convenient location with a variety of restaurants, cafés, supermarkets, drug stores, coin launderettes etc. within walking distance.
昭和を感じさせる浜まで徒歩30秒で行ける海沿いの一軒家をDIYでﾘﾓﾃﾞﾙしました｡施設の名前”Hayamana""はHayama (葉山)とMana(魂)を合わせた造語｡決して豪華ではないけれど､どこか懐かしく､落ち着ける癒しの雰囲気が魅力です｡そして､宿泊施設にはｽﾀﾝﾄﾞｱｯﾌﾟﾊﾟﾄﾞﾙのﾚﾝﾀﾙがあり､初心者はｽｸｰﾙを受けることも可能｡ｵｰﾅｰはPSA(ﾌﾟﾛﾌｪｯｼｮﾅﾙSUP協会)の公認ﾌﾟﾛなので､安心して海のｱｸﾃｨﾋﾞﾃｨを存分に楽しむことができます｡また､意外に知られていない葉山の緑に囲まれたﾄﾚｲﾙ入り口も徒歩5分の所にあります｡各種ﾚｽﾄﾗﾝやｶﾌｪ､ｽｰﾊﾟｰﾏｰｹｯﾄ､ﾄﾞﾗｯｸﾞｽﾄｱ､ｺｲﾝﾗﾝﾄﾞﾘｰなどにも歩いて行ける何かと便利なﾛｹｰｼｮﾝです｡

After a long preparation, Xiaowo finally got ugly to see her in-laws! In addition to the necessary equipment for the hotel, Xiaowo also prepared a variety of books and magazines, go, and cards in Chinese and Japanese. . I hope that when the weather is bad, I will have a good memory when I am in a small home in a foreign country! (And my Japanese CD, if you have a computer or a player, it’s perfect!) Newly bought electric fan in franfran? It’s really cool, no friends! I want to put one in my own home. There are also bowls that are selected together with the children. I also love it. I hope that I can also get the favor of the guests. The nest can accommodate up to 4 people (a bit crowded), recommend 3 people, and walk 3 minutes from the station via the shopping street. In the middle of the famous Yiyuan Garden and the ancient river garden in Japan, it takes about 5 or 6 minutes on foot. At the same time, there are 2 or 3 traditional Japanese commercial streets in the surrounding area, so that you can experience the exotic culture and street culture when you go out a little. There are several supermarkets and drugstores in about 2 minutes. It is very convenient! Because the company was in this area before, so the individual loves it deeply! Looking forward to your inquiry! Yes, I forgot to say that the traffic is also very convenient. It takes only 3 minutes to get off the Yamanote Line, take the tram to Ikebukuro for 6 minutes, and go to Ueno for 10 minutes. The detailed information specific to the airport will be troublesome for you to check it out. (Please refer to the next paragraph for airport information, etc. due to word limit. I am very sorry that there will be duplicate information☺️)
经过漫长的准备,小窝终于丑媳妇要见公婆啦!除了民宿必须的装备,小窝还准备了中日英文的各种书和杂志､围棋､纸牌｡｡希望天气不好时,窝在异国的小小家里,也会有个美好的回忆!(还有我珍藏的日本CD､如果您有电脑或播放器,那就太完美了!)
在franfran里新买的电风扇?,真是酷的没朋友呢!自己家也好想放一台啊｡还有和小朋友们一起挑选的碗具,也是爱不释手,希望同样能得到小窝客人的喜欢｡
小窝最多可入住4人(有点挤),推荐3人,从车站经商店街步行3分钟即可达｡在日本著名庭园的六义园和古河庭园中间,徒步约5､6分钟｡同时周边更是有2､3条日本传统商业街,让您稍稍出门即可体验异国风土人情街巷文化｡走路2分钟左右就有好几家超市､药妆店,非常方便!

6 minutes on foot from Honanmachi Station on the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line, 15 minutes to Shinjuku. Anyway it is old. The unit bath is also old (three-point unit) and the walls are uneven. But there is a clean clean. It is a bit noisy because it is an air conditioner for windows. You can enjoy kotatsu in winter. The nearest convenience store is 210 meters away, 3 minutes on foot, and the shopping street is 220 meters away. Buses are convenient for Nakano, Asagaya, Eifukucho, Shibuya, and Shimokitazawa. There is no TV, so it's a guest room where you can go out in the daytime, just use the shower and toilet, and just sleep. Please note that all guests' passports will be presented and copied at check-in.

Nestle Tokyo Cozy Apartment Hotel is an apartment hotel with the latest amenities and stylish interiors that opened just in December 2018. It's in a quiet residential area so you can rest slowly. The nearest stations are JR Sobu Line Ryogoku Station (9 minutes on foot) and Toei Subway Oedo Line Ryogoku Station (11 minutes on foot). You can reach Akihabara Station, Shinjuku Station, Okubo Station and Nakano Station directly in 10 to 20 minutes on Sobu Line, and it is convenient to access because it is close to sightseeing spots such as Tokyo Sky Tree, Asakusa and Toyosu New Market. There are many express buses from Haneda Airport and Narita Airport to Kinshicho Station next to the station. From Kinshicho Station Ryogoku Station is about 3 minutes. Sumo wrestling with Ryogoku Kokugikan, Sumo Museum, Sumo Room, and Chanko Nabe's shops is a symbol of the city. If you walk around the town you will see sumo wrestling and there will be a sumo wrestling room in front of the room so let's take a memorial photo together! The Sumida River, representing Tokyo, flows nearby. In spring you can enjoy the quaint cherry blossom viewing of cherry blossom trees on both sides, and in summer you will see a fireworks display. I also recommend taking a water bus or a houseboat and watching Tokyo from the river. A great room for travel and business.

You can walk to Ueno and Asakusa! ! Akihabara is also 5 minutes by train! ! Ueno has the National Museum of Western Art, the Ueno Zoo, and Ameyoko, which are ideal for sightseeing. Ameyoko is the best place for shopping. You can buy anything from brands, miscellaneous goods, food, fashion, etc. And because all the prices are very cheap, it is a popular place for Japanese people. The National Museum of Western Art is also recommended. The building designed by Le Corbusier is registered as a World Heritage Site. Asakusa is the most famous tourist destination in Japan. There are plenty of delicious foods around Sensoji Temple, such as “Sushi”, “Tempura” and “Eel”. In Japan, it is called “Shitamachi”, and it is a street with “old Japan” remaining, so you can enjoy it just by walking. There is also a Sky Tree near Asakusa, where you can see the view of Tokyo from the observatory and a large shopping mall. If you book this hotel, you will feel the real “Japan”. Ueno, Asakusa and Sky Tree are all within walking distance, so you can make a wonderful trip.

The house is near Shinjuku, and the tram is only 2 stops (4 minutes) from Shinjuku Station. It is super convenient. The house is in a rare residential area nearby, and it is easy to get to the nearest station in the vicinity of Japan, ""East Nakano Station"". It takes only 6 minutes to walk from the station to the station. There is a shopping street full of Japanese charm. A variety of small shops, medieval shops, gourmet shops, and small local cinemas with a long history. In-depth experience of local Japanese culture, home appliances are complete, washing machine, refrigerator, TV, microwave, hair dryer, mobile Wi-Fi, etc.~ The pots and pans in the kitchen are also very complete, and the knives, chopsticks, spoons, forks, spoons, etc. are complete. It is completely OK to make a delicious meal at home. Bath towels, shampoos, conditioners, toothbrushes, toothpastes, hand soaps, etc. are all available. These are all the warmth of home that you want to experience. PS: 1. Japanese houses are mostly built in wood, and the distance between the neighborhoods of the houses is relatively short, mostly close to each other. If you can't keep quiet when you live, be careful! Especially at night. 2. Please don't drag the suitcase very loudly when you arrive near the house. Please be careful when you are heavy! Especially at night. 3. Please pay attention to the strict classification of garbage. Please note! : There are intensive neighbors in Japan nearby, and it is difficult to guarantee that it is difficult to keep the basic quiet after 21:00.

Thank you very much for seeing it! (^^) My room is about 4 minutes on foot from the nearest station, Shinbaba Station, and close to the airport! The building is a little old, so I decided to make it as luxurious as a hotel, with a particular focus on the interior of the room! The building itself is just off the main street, so the surroundings are quiet and you can relax and sleep at night! The room is larger than 2LDK with 50 square meters or more, so it can accommodate up to 8 people! * There is one sofa bed in the living room. If you are tall, your legs may come out a little. There are plenty of kitchenware and a slightly larger washing machine, so large numbers and long-term stays are welcome! ! Pocket Wi-Fi is also available! Please feel free to contact us as you are familiar with shops and sightseeing spots around here ^ ^ We look forward to your reservations! (^^)
